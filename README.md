# ESPHome Light Gradient ðŸŒˆ
An example how to create color (or brightness) gradient with regular [FastLED](https://esphome.io/components/light/fastled.html) and [Home Assistant](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio.html)

In both devices, I was forced to replace their native controllers (Tuya and Magic Home) with regular esp8266. No additional power tricks were needed. Both devices use ws2812b, or their clones. The pinout was determined with the help of an oscilloscope.

## How it works

Each device in the HASS interface is represented by three entities. Two RGB Lights determine the color at the beginning and end of the gradient. And the Select Template allows you to switch modes of operation of the LED strip, as well as turn it off.

## Disadvantages

- To control one light source, you need to visit three popup dialogs in HASS. Here, scenes help a little
- It's impossible to adequately control the colors from the ESPHome web interface.
